# Description
The first part of the code involves the comparision of the 2 datasets, one consisting of subwords while the other one consists of plain texts of the IMDB movie reviews.

The model here is being trained on the subword dataset.

The second part of the code consists of comparision of various architectures namely LSTM, FLATTEN, GRU, CONV1D.

The models are built on the plain text datasets.
Performance of the model can be clearly viewed from the plots drawn at the end of every model.
